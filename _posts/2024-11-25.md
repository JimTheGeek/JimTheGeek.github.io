# Home Assistant 

Spurred on by one of my team at work building out a new Home Assistant setup I spent most of today (sorry work) adding to my existing setup. 
This started with
1. Creating Proper backups
2. Adding some version management 
3. Trying to figure out why it keeps crashing.  

The crashing I suspect is because it's not running at the right voltage (Damn past me for hooking it up to a PoE adaptor instead of connecting it to mains). This is hopefully easily fixed by a proper power supply which I ordered today. 
Whatch this space. 

The backups are now being managed by a Backup to G-Drive add-in and adding my NAS to the roster. 
Most of my backups were still sitting on the SD card and well that's not very smart. 

The version management was just via git. Nothing special. Just something to make sure if I mess something up that I have some history of where past me went wrong. 

*I'm seeing a theme here about why I'm spending my time on this today. *
