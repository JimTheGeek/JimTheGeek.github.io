# e-ink displays for home
This is something that I've looked at on and off for ages. 
We have a Google Home display in the kitchen, and while it does what it needs to do, it's kinda bulky and takes up valuable bench space. 
Having something that's smaller and we can put things on it as we need to with little effort is a win.

*  Battery Operated, open-source and lots of plugins.
