# e-ink displays for home
This is something that I've looked at on and off for ages. 
We have a Google Home display in the kitchen, and while it does what it needs to do, it's kinda bulky and takes up valuable bench space. 
Having something that's smaller and we can put things on it as we need to with little effort is a win.

*  Battery Operated, open-source and lots of plugins.

# Bobiverse 04: Heaven's River

Well, it's taken me months but I've finally finished reading Heaven's River. It's the first book I've successfully finished reading in months or even a year and it has been nice to get into reading again and trying to do less doom scrolling every night. 
The book was a little rough to get into as it's been years since I read any of the Bobiverse books and I've long forgotten any of the characters or story arc's that had taken place but eventually I got back into it and was very glad that I did.
The story was well structured and while there were a few twists and turns there wasn't anything that I'd say was totally surprising. 
4/5 * - A solid read that I'd read again in the future.
